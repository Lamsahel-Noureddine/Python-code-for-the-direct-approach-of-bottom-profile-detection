# Python-code-for-the-direct-approach-of-bottom-profile-detection
This code provides a direct approach for inferring underwater bathymetry in 1-D shallow water. The code is divided into two parts: a direct solver to generate the free-surface data, and an inverse solver that uses these data to infer the bottom profile.
